    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Iceberg Theories ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect any personal information.</strong></p>
    <p>Our app stores the following data locally on your device only:</p>
    <ul>

        <li>Theories you have marked as favorites</li>
        <li>Your subscription status</li>
        <li>App preferences</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to us or any third parties.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <h2>Analytics and Advertising</h2>
        <p>We use third-party services (such as TikTok for Business) to analyze app usage and measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. These services may collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device identifiers (such as IDFA, when permitted)</li>
            <li>App usage data (such as app launches and in-app events)</li>
            <li>Purchase events</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is collected in accordance with the privacy policies of these third-party services. You can limit ad tracking through your device's privacy settings.</p>
    <p>Our app uses Apple's StoreKit for processing in-app purchases. These transactions are handled entirely by Apple according to their privacy policy. We do not have access to your payment information.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All app data is stored locally on your device using iOS's standard storage mechanisms. If you delete the app, all locally stored data will be removed.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. The app contains content that may not be suitable for young children.</p>
